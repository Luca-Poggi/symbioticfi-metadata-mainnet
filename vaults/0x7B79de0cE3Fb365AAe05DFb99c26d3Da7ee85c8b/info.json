  "description": "Ethereum blockchain has just one single stake token - ETH - but a network on Symbiotic has to deal with multiple delegated collaterals, making it complex for optimisation. This vault changes that. Untangled Credio x OETH Vault brings risk-adjusted restaking yield to OETH deposits with a novel mechanism to abstract all collateral delegations to a network into a single token - Synthetic Stake Token - enabling new opportunities for networks and stakers to optimize risk/reward.",
